               <h2>Introduction</h2>
               <p>Gunther Bailey is deep, nuanced character with an complex narrative arc involving dramatic personal conflict, 
                betrayal, deception, and eventual redemption. He utilizes a blend of melee combat and supplemental magic to 
                suppress foes and bolster allies. While he is not the most intelligent character, he makes up for by being very
                charismatic and quite intimidating when necessary.</p>

               <h2>Backstory</h2>
               <p>Gunther was born to a human mother in a small village in Faeru&#770n. His father was of celestial descent and 
                was not present for his childhood, although he had heard many stories from his mother of his nobility. This inner 
                connection to his divine bloodline drew him to study theology at the nearby Church of the Trinity. It was here that 
                he discovered that while he lacked scholastic abilities, he excelled at physical and social interactions. because 
                of this, he was conscripted into the Everwatch and trained as a paladin of Helm. One of the duties of the Everwatch
                Knights was mercenary work as fundraising for the Church. As he was searching for employers, he was approached by 
                a Wood Elf named Sicarius. A mercenary and scout by trade, Sicarius needed assistance with a particularly difficult 
                assignment. He hired Gunther as a lookout while he performed surveillance on a group of smugglers, but when he was 
                discovered, he had to make a quick exit. As Sicarius ran past while being pursued by three of the smugglers, Gunther 
                stood his ground and not only held back the smugglers, but subdued them and helped Sicarius escape. After that, 
                Sicarius permanently hired Gunther as a bodyguard. They eventually found regular work in the Underdark, where they 
                continue to do business today.

           <section id="Story Arc">
               <h2>Story Arc</h2>
               <p>Gunther has several defining characteristics in his build. He is a Protector Aasimar, a Paladin of Redemption, and is 
                generally Lawful Good. However, the Underdark has a way of changing a person. Over the course of the campaign, due to 
                madness, fatigue, and the influence of the infernal, Gunther will slowly begin to shift from a champion of goodness, to 
                a jaded, cynical knight of dread. At his lowest point, his Aasimar subrace will shift to a Fallen, and he will break 
                his sworn paladin oath as he learns not all people deserve redemption. The evil of the Underdark will influence his 
                thinking, but one thing will not change: his loyalty to those he is sworn to protect.

           <section id="Build">
               <h2>Build</h2>
               <p>The initial build is pretty standard for a paladin. The main stats are going to Charisma and Constitution, as Gunther 
                plays pretty heavily as a front line protector and tank. Strength is usually favored over Dexterity in order to meet 
                heavy armor requirements and since maxing out attack damage is a better threat strategy than light finesse weapons. 
                Intelligence and Wisdom can both be used as dump stats, though Wisdom can be helpful for saving throws.
               </p>
               <p>As you level, prioritize Charisma first as spells will be important for control and smites. For additional flexibility, 
                a single level of Warlock is helpful to acquire cantrips, and it is easily worked into the story arc. (Don't dip until at 
                least level 5, so you can get Extra Attack as soon as possible.) This is also a good time to begin preparing to shift from 
                Protector to Fallen Aasimar, and from Redemption to Oathbreaker Paladin.

           <section id="Playstyle">
               <h2>Playstyle</h2>
               <p>At the beginning, Gunther is a very light-hearted and good-natured character. He is fiercely loyal to the party members, 
                but it is not unlikely for him to favor some over others. He acts with his heart and not his head, so can occasionally be 
                reckless and headstrong, and is very naive when it comes to the motivations of others. As the campaign progresses, and 
                the stress of keeping the party safe gets overwhelming, Gunther's personality will shift. He will become less light-hearted, 
                and more brooding. He will become less naive, and more suspicious. Most unnerving though, especially to himself, is he will 
                fight less to defend, and more from a sense of excitement. He will begin to relish striking down that which opposes him, and 
                not just neutralizing threats to his friends, but destroying them entirely. No matter how dark he gets though, his devotion 
                to the party is never compromised.
